# Actual network requests
> HTTP / API / REST / GraphQL / Idk who uses SOAP anymore but sure, that too
For functions that help with network requests but don't actually make a request themselves, see `../req`.
For example, if you were to make SOAP requests, the pure function to parse the XML would be in `../req`.
